1. I hope you never accomplish your goals

Most people think that by achieving the goals in mind, all their worries
are going to dissolve (for example, buying a new house, getting a
promotion, losing 10 pounds).

You believe happiness is always in the future and comes from something
or someone outside yourself.

Thinking that peace and harmony come from situations matching your
expectations is an illusion.

Instead of chasing after goals, install these systems:

1. a system of gratitude
2. a system of enjoying this moment
3. a system of expansion

Gratitude always brings your attention to the present moment.
