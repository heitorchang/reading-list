1. The Goal

Think through best/worst-case scenarios but only write down a specific goal that represents the best case

Set an optimistic but reasonable goal and define it clearly

Write it down

Discuss your goal with a colleague (this makes it harder to wimp out)

Carry the written goal into the negotiation


2. Summary

Summarize and write out in just a couple of sentences the known facts that have led up to the negotiation

Summarize a situation in a way that your counterpart will respond with a "that's right"


3. Labels/Accusation Audit

Prepare three to five labels to perform an accusation audit (accusations they might make about you)

Labels:

It seems like ___ is valuable to you
It seems you don't like ___
It seems like you value ___
It seems like ___ makes it easier
It seems like you're reluctant to ___
It seems that you're worried about ___


4. Calibrated questions

Prepare three to five calibrated questions to reveal value to you and your counterpart and identify and overcome potential deal killers

How am I supposed to do that?

What are we trying to accomplish?
How is that worthwhile?
What's the core issue here?
How does that affect things?
What's the biggest challenge you face?
How does this fit into what the objective is?


How to identify behind-the-table deal killers

How does this affect the rest of your team?
How on board are the people not on this call?
What do your colleagues see as their main challenges in this area?


Think about their perceived losses. Negotiations often hinge on self-esteem, status, and autonomy


Questions to unearth the deal-killing issues

What are we up against here?
What is the biggest challenge you face?
What happens if you do nothing?
How does making this deal resonate with what your company prides itself on?
