It is possible to define the column names of the CTE:

with head_count_tab (job, head_count) as (
  select job, count(empno)
  from emp
  group by job
)
select max(head_count) as highest_job_count
from head_count_tab;

    return a


with recursive working_table (a, b, index1) as (
  select 0, 1, 1
  union all
  select b, a + b, index1 + 1
