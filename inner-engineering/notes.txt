*** Preface

Spurious and dangerously misleading teachings in vogue today:

- Be in the moment (rebuttal: the present is the only place you CAN be. You need to take charge of your mind. The past and the future are simply a play of memory and imagination)

- Do only one thing at a time (rebuttal: harness and learn to ride the mind)

- Positive thinking (rebuttal: it is a quick-fix mantra, a way of sugarcoating your reality)

- Claim that Love is the core of the universe (rebuttal: Love is a human possibility. Your dog is full of love)

All of these puerile philosophies come from the assumption that existence is human-centric

Truth is timeless, but technology is contemporary

*** When I Lost my Sense

Who is God? Where is he? If the world is round, where is up?

Language is nothing but a conspiracy between humans. From the sounds from the mouth, the listener makes up the meanings

"I do not know" is the ONLY door to seeking and knowing

The way the body pulses, the way organs function, the fact that boundaries are limited to the external world

To really know spirituality, don't look FOR anything. Otherwise, the problem is that you have already defined what you are looking for. The important thing is the faculty of looking

Sadhguru only thought about HOW he wanted to live life, not WHAT or WHY

One day, he experienced the miraculous alchemy of digestion--the process by which an external substance becomes a part of him

The source of creation and life is an intelligence far greater than human logical intelligence

Life is the ultimate intelligence. Human intellect is mere smartness that ensures survival

Human nature is such that we always yearn to be something more than what we are right now (example: wanting a larger and larger cubicle)

Freedom is seen as the natural longing in every human being

*** The way out is in

Everything you have done in your life was because of Joy.

Life begins with survival

Well-being is a deep sense of pleasantness; we call this 'health'

If your body feels very pleasant, we call it 'pleasure'

If your mind becomes pleasant, we call it 'joy'

If your emotions become pleasant, we call it 'love'

Other words: compassion, bliss, ecstasy.

When your surroundings become pleasant, it is 'success'

Pleasantness is the only goal

What's happening in your head is YOUR dream.

Even if the world doesn't happen the way you want it, at least your thoughts and emotions should happen the way you want them to.

Our inner ecology is a mess. The life process of earning a living, reproducing, and raising a family is a struggle. Animals do so effortlessly

Unless we do the right things, the right things will not happen to us

You can bullshit yourself into all kinds of emotional states, but the problem is that it won't last.

The source of human experience comes from within: pain or pleasure, joy or misery, agony or ecstasy

The human folly is to try to extract joy from the outside.

You see the whole world within yourself.

There exists a bliss narcotic that is created and consumed by your own system.

Most people think peace and joy are the goals of spiritual life. In reality, they are not things you attain at the end of life. They are the basis of your life

Human life is longing for unlimited expansion

The spiritual quest is a natural longing. You must handle it consciously. Only when you are blissful will you be in the highest state of receptivity. If keeping yourself pleasant is a big challenge, you can't take on other challenges.

The reason simple things like being joyful and loving have become ultimate aspirations is that people are living without paying attention to the life process.

Most people refer to "life" as the accessories of life: work, family, relationships, homes, cars, clothes, or gods they pray to.

The foundations of peace and bliss are not about attending to external realities, but in accessing and organizing the inner nature of your being

When you realize that all you experience is within, this homecoming is enlightenment

The reason enlightenment is so far away is that we have categorized the world into good and bad, God and Devil, heaven and hell. Loving your enemy is hard when you have labeled them.

Adiyogi said that judgments like up and down, good and bad, are all assumed. Inward and outward is the one context we are sure of.

The only way out is in

*** Design your Destiny

When it is someone else's problem, it's destiny. But if my stomach is empty, I will have my own plan

Destiny has become a scapegoat, a way to deal with failure, a fatalistic ruse to reconcile ourselves to uncomfortable situations. It is a consoling word, but disempowering

To be human means you can mold situations you are living in the way you want them

What you know as "myself" is just an accumulation. It can be yours, but it can never be you.

Creating your own destiny does not mean you have to control every situation in the world. It is about steadily heading toward your well-being and ultimate nature, no matter what is around you. You RIDE the situations, not get crushed by them.

When you pursue your likes and dislikes, you feel alone. Once existence yields to you, it delivers you to a different place of grace.

Judgments about good and bad are essentially human and socially conditioned. But existence is not judgmental

*** No boundary, No burden

Story: A husband and wife who agreed that the first one to speak had to close the door. Neither side wanted to do it so they sat in silence. Meanwhile, thieves came in and even shaved the man's mustache.

There are situations in life that hinge on the question: who's responsible?

You have refined the old blame game into a fine art.

Responsibility is much misunderstood. It does not mean taking on the burdens of the world. It does not mean accepting blame for the things you have done or not. It is not about guilt.

Responsibility is simply about your Ability to respond. All it requires is for you to realize what exactly you are responsible for and what you are not. If you decide "I am responsible," you will have the ability to respond.

Only if you realize you are responsible do you have the freedom to create yourself the way you want to be, not as a reaction to the situations in which you exist.

Reactivity is enslavement. Responsibility is freedom.

When you are able to create yourself the way you want, you can create the life the way you want as well.

While your outer life is not 100% under your control, you can be 100% in control of your inner life.

Spur of the moment, reactive emotions like anger typically don't end well.

Humans are in a perennial state of complaint

The choice is to respond consciously to the present, or react compulsively to it.

in conscious response, every life situation can be seen as an opportunity for growth

If you habitually think "I am the way I am because of someone else," you are using life situations merely as opportunities for self-destruction or stagnation

Story: a girl who berated her brother for forgetting his shoes as they were taken to Nazi concentration camps never saw him again. She decided to never again speak to anyone in a way that she may later regret, because it could be the last time they see each other.

if you take no responsibilty for the way you are now, you have forsaken your future

Resentment, anger, jealousy, pain, are poisons you drink but expect someone else to die.
