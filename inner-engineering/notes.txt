*** Preface

Spurious and dangerously misleading teachings in vogue today:

- Be in the moment (rebuttal: the present is the only place you CAN be. You need to take charge of your mind. The past and the future are simply a play of memory and imagination)

- Do only one thing at a time (rebuttal: harness and learn to ride the mind)

- Positive thinking (rebuttal: it is a quick-fix mantra, a way of sugarcoating your reality)

- Claim that Love is the core of the universe (rebuttal: Love is a human possibility. Your dog is full of love)

All of these puerile philosophies come from the assumption that existence is human-centric

Truth is timeless, but technology is contemporary

*** When I Lost my Sense

Who is God? Where is he? If the world is round, where is up?

Language is nothing but a conspiracy between humans. From the sounds from the mouth, the listener makes up the meanings

"I do not know" is the ONLY door to seeking and knowing

The way the body pulses, the way organs function, the fact that boundaries are limited to the external world

To really know spirituality, don't look FOR anything. Otherwise, the problem is that you have already defined what you are looking for. The important thing is the faculty of looking

Sadhguru only thought about HOW he wanted to live life, not WHAT or WHY

One day, he experienced the miraculous alchemy of digestion--the process by which an external substance becomes a part of him

The source of creation and life is an intelligence far greater than human logical intelligence

Life is the ultimate intelligence. Human intellect is mere smartness that ensures survival

Human nature is such that we always yearn to be something more than what we are right now (example: wanting a larger and larger cubicle)

Freedom is seen as the natural longing in every human being
