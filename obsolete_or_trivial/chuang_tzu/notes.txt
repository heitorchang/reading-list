Life and death are inevitable. Heaven gives them the constancy of day and night. And we can't alter any of it -- it belongs to the very nature of things.

p. 87

We're cast into this human form, and it's such happiness. This human form knows change, but the ten thousand changes are utterly boundless. Who could calculate the joys they promise?

And so the sage wanders where nothing is hidden and everything is preserved. The sage calls dying young a blessing and living long a blessing, calls beginnings a blessing and endings a blessing. We might make such a person our teacher, but there's something the ten thousand things belong to, something all change depends upon -- imagine making that your teacher!
