PLOT

2 Puzzle was more of a servant than friend to Shift

2 Caldron Pool is under the cliffs at the western end of Narnia into which the great waterfall pours. On the other side flows the River of Narnia

12 Shift wants Puzzle to impersonate Aslan to tell others what to do

19 According to the centaur Roonwit, evil is in Narnia; it could not be that Aslan came

21 Trees in Lantern Waste being cut down

25 Much evil came from the rashness of the King (in his anger) to see who was chopping down the trees

28 Tirian and Jewel kill two Calormenes who were forcing a Narnian horse to drag logs

42 Tirian wants to show that Tash is not Aslan but gets struck and tied to a tree

53 Tirian calls for help, is transported (in a dream?) to a table with children (Peter the High King)

127 Shift says how a donkey is in the woods pretending to be Aslan, ruining Tirian's plan
