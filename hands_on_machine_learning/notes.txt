Preface
-------
a deep neural net is a simplified model of our cerebral cortex, composed of a stack of layers of neurons.

the goal is implementing programs capable of learning from data.

frameworks used:
- Scikit-Learn (implements many machine-learning algorithms)
- TensorFlow (runs neural networks)
- Keras (a deep learning API)

code in this book can be run in Google Colab

Part I covers:

- what is machine learning?
- the steps in a typical machine learning project
- fitting a model to data
- optimizing a cost function
- handling, cleaning, and preparing data
- selecting and engineering features
- selecting a model and tuning hyperparameters using cross-validation
- challenges in machine learning (underfitting, overfitting, bias/variance trade-off)
- the most common algorithms:
  - linear and polynomial regression
  - logistic regression
  - k-nearest neighbors
  - support vector machines (SVMs)
  - decision trees
  - random forests
  - ensemble methods
- reducing the dimensionality of training data (fight the "curse of dimensionality")
- unsupervised learning techniques:
  - clustering
  - density estimation
  - anomaly detection

Part II covers:

- what are neural nets?
- building and training neural nets using TensorFlow and Keras
- the most important neural net architectures:
  - feedforward neural nets for tabular data
  - convolutional nets for computer vision
  - recurrent nets and long short-term memory (LSTM) nets for sequence processing
  - encoder-decoders and transformers for natural language processing (NLP) and more
  - autoencoders
  - generative adversarial networks (GANs)
  - diffusion models for generative learning
- how to build an agent (such as a bot) that can learn strategies from trial and error, using reinforcement learning
- loading and preprocessing large amounts of data
- training and deploying TensorFlow models at scale
