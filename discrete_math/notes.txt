p. 6 The Conditional Statement

p -> q

p  q  p -> q
T  T    T
T  F    F
F  T    T
F  F    T

p. 72 Rules of inference (modus ponens, modus tollens, syllogisms)

Modus ponens

p
p -> q
-----------
therefore q

Modus tollens

NOT q
p -> q
---------------
therefore NOT p


p. 134 Bit string representation of sets

Suppose U = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 0} and the ordering of the elements of U has the elements in increasing order.

The odd integers is  10 1010 1010 (grouped by four for easy reading)
The even integers is 01 0101 0101
The first five are   11 1110 0000


p. 139

Definition: If f is a function from A to B, A is the domain of f and
B is the codomain of f.


p. 141

Q: What is an injective function?

A: A one-to-one function. A function f is injective if and only if
f(a) = f(b) implies that a = b


Q: What is a surjective function?

A: An onto function. A function f from A to B is surjective if and only if for every element b in B there is a f(a) = b (all points in the codomain are assigned)


p. 144

Q: What is a bijection?

A: A one-to-one correspondence.
A function that is both one-to-one and onto.


p. 158 Recurrence relation

The initial conditions for a recursively defined sequence specify the terms that precede the first term where the recurrence relation takes effect.


p. 166 Closed form solutions for common sums

SUM (a * r^k)
SUM (k), (k^2), (k^3), (x^k)


p. 195 Binary search

p. 197 Bubble sort

p. 198 Insertion sort

p. 201 Greedy algorithm for scheduling talks
In each step, select the talk with the earliest ending time among the talks compatible with those already selected
