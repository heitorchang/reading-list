11.3 Statistical tests of hypotheses

null hypothesis
alternative hypothesis

atable.sample(27, with_replacement=False)

The P-value is the "observed significance level" of the test.

If the P-value is < 5%, it is "statistically significant"
If the P-value is < 1%, it is "highly statistically significant"

12.1 A/B testing

smoking mothers

null hypothesis: The distribution of birth weights of babies is the same for mothers who don't smoke as for mothers who do.

the difference in the sample is due to chance.

alternative hypothesis: The babies of mothers who smoke have a lower birth weight

to test, we draw a random sample without replacement

testing the null hypothesis: if there were no difference between the two distributions, then whether a birth weight has the label True or False (for smoking) should make no difference to the average. (permutation test)
