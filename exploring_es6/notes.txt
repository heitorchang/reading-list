A protocol defines interfaces (signatures for methods and functions) and rules for using them
The idea is to specify how a service is to be performed

Given obj.meth(), obj is the receiver of the method call, and accessible via 'this'

The (type) signature of a function describes how the function is to be called, and what its inputs and outputs are
For example, parseInt(string : string, radix? : number) : number

Implementations of internal slots are left unspecified.

An environment stores the variables of a scope and is basically a dictionary that maps variable names to values.

A binding is an entry in an environment

Destructive methods and functions modify their parameters or receivers.
