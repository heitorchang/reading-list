A protocol defines interfaces (signatures for methods and functions) and rules for using them
The idea is to specify how a service is to be performed

Given obj.meth(), obj is the receiver of the method call, and accessible via 'this'

The (type) signature of a function describes how the function is to be called, and what its inputs and outputs are
For example, parseInt(string : string, radix? : number) : number

Implementations of internal slots are left unspecified.

An environment stores the variables of a scope and is basically a dictionary that maps variable names to values.

A binding is an entry in an environment

Destructive methods and functions modify their parameters or receivers.

TC39 is ECMA (European Computer Manufacturers Association) Technical Committee 39. It meets regularly and invites experts to evolve JavaScript



http://exploringjs.com/es6/ch_one-javascript.html

Evolution without versioning is possible by always being backward-compatible

let is a block-scoped version of var. Variables declared with var are function-scoped

const is used for variables whose values never change

(avoid var)

Using a block and a let declaration, we restrict the scope of a variable to that block.

{  // open block
	let tmp = ...;
	...
}  // close block

Template literals use the backtick and ${x}

function printCoord(x, y) {
	console.log(`(${x}, ${y})`);
}

Template literals can also span multiple lines

const HTML5_SKELETON = `
	<!doctype html>
	<html>
	...
	</html>`;

Arrow functions don't shadow this

function UiComponent() {
	var button = document.getElementById('myButton');
	button.addEventListener('click', () => {
		console.log("click");
		this.handleClick();
	});
}

Arrow functions are also used for short callbacks that only return results of expressions

const squares = arr.map(x => x * x);
'(x) => x * x' and 'x => x * x' are both allowed

Destructuring makes code simpler by making temporary variables unnecessary

const [, year, month, day] =
	/^(\d\d\d\d)-(\d\d)-(\d\d)$/
	.exec('2999-12-31');

The empty slot at the beginning skips the Array element at index zero.

const {writable, configurable} is an abbreviation for { writable: writable, configurable: configurable }

const {writable, configurable} = Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor(obj, 'foo');

for-of is concise and you can break from it.

const arr = ['a', 'b', 'c'];
for (const elem of arr) {
	console.log(elem);
}

for (const [index, elem] of arr.entries()) {  // destructuring
	console.log(index + '. ' + elem);
}

Default values for parameters may be defined in the signature

function foo(x=0, y=0) {
	...
}

Handling named parameters is also done with destructuring

function selectEntries({ start=0, end=-1, step=1 }) {
	...
}

To make the parameter optional, specify {} as a parameter default value

function selectEntries({ start=0, end=-1, step=1 } = {}) {
	...
}

Rest parameters are used to accept an arbitrary number of arguments via the ... operator

Trailing parameters appear after required parameters

function format(pattern, ...args) {
	...
}

... is also the spread operator, that turns arrays into parameters

Math.max(...[-1, 5, 11, 3])

Array.prototype.push() appends all of its arguments as elements to its receiver. There is no method that destructively appends an Array to another one

arr1.push(...arr2);

The spread operator can also non-destructively turn the contents of its operand into Array elements.

const arr1 = ['a', 'b'];
const arr2 = ['c'];
const arr3 = ['d', 'e'];

console.log([...arr1, ...arr2, ...arr3]);

Methods are properties whose values are functions

Method definitions is a special syntax for creating methods

const obj = {
	foo() {
		...
	},
	bar() {
		this.foo();
	},
}

Classes provide syntax for constructor functions and method definitions. There are no commas between the parts of a class

class Person {
	constructor(name) {
		this.name = name;
	}
	describe() {
		return 'Person called ' + this.name;
	}
}

Subclassing is done with 'extends'

class Employee extends Person {
	constructor(name, title) {
		super(name);
		this.title = title;
	}
	describe() {
		return super.describe() + ' (' + this.title + ')';
	}
}

'Map' is a built-in data structure that can use arbitrary values as keys, and keys don't have to be escaped

const map = new Map();
function countWords(word) {
	const count = map.get(word) || 0;
	map.set(word, count + 1);
}

Strings' beginning and end can be checked with .startswith('abc') and .endswith('xyz'). Contents may be checked with .includes('jkl'). They have an optional second parameter, which specifies where the string to be searched starts or ends.

Strings may be repeated with .repeat(numberOfTimes)

arr.findIndex(x => Number.isNaN(x));  // can be used to find NaN in an Array

const arr = Array.from(arguments);

const arr1 = [...'abc'];
	// ['a', 'b', 'c']

const arr = new Array(2).fill('x');
	// ['x', 'x']

Multiple exports are called 'named exports'

// -- lib.js --
export const sqrt = Math.sqrt;
export function square(x) {
	return x * x;
}
export function diag(x, y) {
	return sqrt(square(x) + square(y));
}

// -- main1.js --
import { square, diag } from 'lib';
console.log(square(11));
console.log(diag(3, 4)); 

// -- main2.js --
import * as lib from 'lib';  // import modules as objects
console.log(lib.square(11));
console.log(lib.diag(3, 4)); 

Single exports are done via a 'default export'

// -- myFunc.js --
export default function () { ... }  // no semicolon

// -- main1.js --
import myFunc from 'myFunc';
myFunc();

'\u{1F680}' is a Unicode escape that lets you specify any code point

With String.raw`Not a newline: \n` backslashes are not special and escapes are not interpreted.

Strings are iterable, which means that you can use for-of to iterate over their characters and use ... to turn them into Arrays

To count the Unicode code points in a string, use iteration (convert it to an Array) and get its length: [...'x\uD83D\uDE80y'].length

To reverse a string with non-BMP code points (larger than 16 bits) [...str].reverse().join('') However, this approach does not work with combining marks. A library such as Esrever is needed.

The method codePointAt(idx) returns the numeric value of a code point. The opposite is String.fromCodePoint(i)

String.prototype.match(regexp) calls regexp[Symbol.match](this)

String.prototype.replace(searchValue, replaceValue) calls searchValue[Symbol.replace](this, replaceValue)

String.prototype.search(regexp) calls regexp[Symbol.search](this)

String.prototype.split(separator, limit) calls separator[Symbol.split](this, limit)

The parameters don't have to be regular expressions anymore. Any objects with appropriate methods will do.



http://exploringjs.com/es6/ch_symbols.html

Symbols are a primitive type that serve as unique IDs. They are created via a factory function

const mySymbol = Symbol('mySymbol');

Every time you call Symbol('Red'), a new symbol is created.

The optional parameter is a descriptive string that is shown when printing the symbol.

Symbols are mainly used as unique property keys (they do not clash with other symbols or strings).

An object can be made iterable by using Symbol.iterator as the key of a method

const iterableObject = {
	[Symbol.iterator]() {  // enables the use of the for-of loop
		...
	}
}
for (const x of iterableObject) {
	console.log(x);
}

The only way to convert a Symbol to a String is with an explicit call:
const sym = Symbol('desc');
String(sym)  // 'Symbol(desc)'

The following operations are aware of symbols as property keys:

Reflect.ownKeys()
Property access via []
Object.assign()

The following operations ignore symbols as property keys:

Object.keys()
Object.getOwnPropertyNames()
for-in loop

Symbols can be used as property keys

Classes and object literals have a feature called 'computed property keys': the key of a property is specified via an expression in square brackets.

const MY_KEY = Symbol();

const obj = {
	[MY_KEY]: 123
};

const FOO = Symbol();
const obj2 = {
	[FOO]() {
		return 'bar';
	}
};
console.log(obj2[FOO]());  // bar

Property keys are either strings or symbols
String-valued property keys are called property names
Symbol-valued property keys are called property symbols

Object.getOwnPropertyNames() ignores symbol-valued property keys
Object.getOwnPropertySymbols() ignores string-valued property keys
Reflect.ownKeys() considers all kinds of keys
Object.keys(obj) only considers enumerable property keys that are strings

Strings do not work well as enum constants because they may be used in different contexts (COLOR_BLUE and MOOD_BLUE). Using symbols, each value is unique.

const COLOR_BLUE = Symbol('Blue');

Symbols are useful for non-public properties in inheritance hierarchies and to keep meta-level properties from clashing with base-level properties.

Whenever there are inheritance hierarchies (via classes, mixins, or a prototypical approach), there are public and private properties.

Public properties are seen by clients, and private ones are used internally. Protected properties are shared between the several pieces.

Public properties usually have string keys, but symbols are better for private ones to avoid accidental name clashes.

Typically, all own property keys can be found with Reflect.ownKeys()

An object is iterable if it has a method whose key is the symbol Symbol.iterator.

const iterableObj = {
	data: ['Hello', 'world'],
	[Symbol.iterator]() {
		...
	}
}

for (const x of obj) {
	console.log(x);
}

Converting symbols to other primitive types may be explicit or implicit (coercion)

To			Explicit					Implicit	
boolean		Boolean(sym)   -> OK		!sym     -> OK
number		Number(sym)    -> TypeError	sym * 2  -> TypeError
string		String(sym)    -> OK		'' + sym -> TypeError
			sym.toString() -> OK		`${sym}` -> TypeError
object		Object(sym)    -> OK		Object.keys(sym) -> OK

Boolean() returns true for symbols

It is possible to create wrapper objects, instances of Symbol. Object, called as a function, converts all values to objects.

const sym = Symbol();
typeof sym  // 'symbol'
const wrapper = Object(sym);
typeof wrapper  // 'object'
wrapper instanceof Symbol  // true

[] normally coerces its operand to string, but it also unwraps symbol wrapped objects

A code realm is a context in which pieces of code exist. 

Symbol() is a factory for symbols. Each value it returns is unique

The global object Symbol has several properties that serve as constants, called well-known symbols.

For customizing basic language operations:

- Symbol.hasInstance (method, customizes the behavior of x instanceof C

- Symbol.toPrimitive (method, customizes how it is converted to a primitive value)

- Symbol.toStringTag (string, called by Object.prototype.toString() to compute the default string description of obj)

- Symbol.unscopables (Object, lets an object hide some properties from the with statement)

Iteration:

- Symbol.iterator (method, a method with this key makes an object iterable)

Miscellaneous:

- Symbol.species (method, configures how built-in methods such as Array.prototype.map()) create objects that are similar to this

- Symbol.isConcatSpreadable (boolean, configures whether Array.prototype.concat() adds the indexed elements of an object to its result ("spreading") or the object as a single element)

If you want a symbol to be the same in all realms, you need to use the global symbol registry, via the following two methods:

Symbol.for(str) returns the symbol whose key is the string str in the registry. If str is not yet in the registry, a new symbol is created and filed in the registry.

Symbol.keyFor(sym) returns the string that is associated with the symbol sym. If sym is not in the registry, this method returns undefined. This method can be used to serialize symbols (e.g. to JSON)



http://exploringjs.com/es6/ch_template-literals.html

Despite their similar names and appearance, template literals and tagged template literals are quite different.

- Template literals (code) are multi-line string literals that support interpolation
- Tagged template literals (code) are function calls
- Web templates (data) are HTML with blanks to be filled in

A template literal is a string literal:

const firstName = 'Jane';
console.log(`Hello ${firstName}!
How are you
today?`);

A tagged template literal (or simply tagged template) is created by mentioning a function before a template literal:

String.raw`A \tagged\ template`
// 'A \\tagged\\ template'

Tagged templates are function calls. String.raw is called to produce the result.

The backslash is used for escaping inside template literals.

`${`  // SyntaxError
`\${`  // '${'

Other than the backtick and ${, the backslash works like in string literals

In template literals, all line terminators are normalized to \n

Putting a template literal after an expression triggers a function call (similar to how a parameter list (comma-separated values in parentheses) triggers a function call)

tagFunction`Hello ${firstName} ${lastName}!`

is equivalent to

tagFunction(['Hello ', ' ', '!'], firstName, lastName)

(in reality, the first parameter is more than just an Array)

The function to call is the tag function

The tag function receives two types of data:

- Template strings such as 'Hello ', known at compile time (statically)
- Substitutions such as firstName. A substitution can be any expression, known at runtime (dynamically)

Tag functions also get two versions of each template string:

- A raw version in which backslashes are not interpreted
- A cooked version in which backslashes are special (`\n` becomes a newline)

Examples:

const str = String.raw`Multi-line text
Escapes are not interpreted
\n is not a newline.`;

const proc = sh`ps ax | grep ${pid}`;

POST`http://foo.org/bar?a=${a}`
(myOnReadyStateChangeHandler);

t7.js is an alternative to JSX (a language extension in Facebook React) and uses templates tagged with t7.

Text localization (L10N)

msg`Welcome to ${siteName}, visitor number ${visitorNumber}:d!`;

The :d annotation affects the substitution formatting

A template is basically a function: data in, text out.

For production code, use Handlebars.js

Prefixing ${} with an exclamation mark, !${addr.first}, will escape characters such as < and >

The number of template strings is always one plus the number of substitutions. If a substitution is first in a literal, it is prefixed by an empty template string. If a substitution is last in a literal, it is suffixed by an empty template string.

An empty template literal produces one (empty) template string and no substitutions.

The tag function 'describe' shows the Cooked and Raw interpretations of template strings

if-then-else inside a template can be done via the ternary operator (cond ? then : else) or the logical Or operator (||)

!${addr.first || '(No first name)'}

Regular expression instances can be created statically (at compile time) via a regular expression literal: /^abc$/i

Or dynamically (at runtime), via the RegExp constructor: new RegExp('^abc$', 'i')

"Template string" is the old name for "template literal"
"Template handler" is the old name for "tag function"
