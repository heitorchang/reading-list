  <!-- Saint Francis de Sales -->

<pre style="font-family: serif;">

Do not look with fear
on the changes and chances of this life;
rather, look to them with full faith that as they arise,
God--whose you are--will deliver you out of them.

He has kept you hitherto;
do not but hold fast to His dear hand,
and He will lead you safely through all things.
And when you cannot stand,
He will bear you in His arms

Do not anticipate what will happen tomorrow.
The same everlasting Father who cares for you today
will take care of you tomorrow and every day.
Either He will shield you from suffering,
or He will give you unfailing strength to bear it.

Be at peace then, and put aside
all anxious thoughts and imaginations.
