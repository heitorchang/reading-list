p 31 (2.2) NetworkX simple example

p 44 (3) The "small world property" is that the average distance between nodes, measured in number of edges on the shortest path, is much smaller than expected

p 45 The typical distance between any two people in a social network is about "six degrees of separation"

p 47 (3.3) The degree of a node is its number of neighbors

p 72 (4.5) The Barabasi-Albert model uses "preferential attachment": a new edge is more likely to connect to a vertex that already has a large number of edges (the rich get richer)

Graphs that have a degree distribution obeying a power law are called scale-free networks.

Note: The actor network is not connected, so you might want to use nx.connected_component_subgraphs to find connected subsets of the nodes.
