General
-------

Strings must be double-quoted. Single quotes are used for characters.

Built-in types:
String, Char, Boolean, Int, Double, List, Set, Map

const declares compile-time constants, while val are for runtime constants

Only primitives can be used as consts.
String, Int, Double, Float, Long, Short, Byte, Char, Boolean


Ch. 3

Java has reference types and primitive types; however, Kotlin only has reference types.

val race = "gnome"
val faction: String = when (race) {
    "dwarf" -> "Keepers of the mines"
    "gnome" -> "Tinkerers"
    "orc", "human" -> "Free people"
    else -> "Shadow cabal"
}

when {
    expPoints > requiredExpPoints -> {
        "you already leveled up"
    }
}

These are true:
1 in 1..3
3 in 1..3
3 in 3 downTo 1
1 in 3 downTo 1

These are false:
5 in 1 until 5
3 in 5 until 1 // cannot go backwards

Ch. 4

Unit functions do not define a return type and do not have a return statement.

Their return type is Unit.

Nothing, like Unit, indicates that a function returns no value. However, a Nothing lets the compiler know that a function is guaranteed to never complete successfully.

The TODO function returns Nothing

fun shouldReturnAString(): String {
    TODO("implement this function")
}

Within backticks, a wide variety of function identifiers may be used:

fun `users should be signed out`() {
    TODO()
}
