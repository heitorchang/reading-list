Live for today
Accept the worst case possible but seek to improve it if it happens
Write down the facts, outcomes, and solutions
Stay busy. Ignore trifles.
Measure likelihoods (probabilities) of negative events happening
Make others happy but don't expect gratitude
Do your best
Take notes on your mistakes
Relax. Stay organized.
