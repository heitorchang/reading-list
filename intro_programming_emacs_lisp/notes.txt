page number refers to absolute pdf's page, not book's page

17 lists look like '(rose violet daisy buttercup). ' is "quote"

17 atoms are separated by whitespace and may be numbers, strings and symbols

18 () is both an atom and a list

20 q exits the debugger

25 a symbol may be called a variable because it holds a value that may vary

25 a symbol can have both a value and a function attached to it (think of a symbol being a chest of drawers, with a drawer for a value and another for a function)

26 binding a variable to a value is assigning it a value

28 (concat "abc" "def") produces "abcdef"

28 (substring "The quick brown fox jumped." 16 19) produces "fox"

28 (substring STRING BEGINNING-ZERO-INDEXED-INCLUSIVE END-EXCLUSIVE)

28 (number-to-string NUMBER) (int-to-string NUMBER)

29, 32, 34 'hello is a quoted symbol. It is the symbol itself. A quoted expression is returned as written, and not evaluated

30 marker is a special object representing a buffer position

30 -p at the end of a function stands for "predicate". The function determines whether some property is true or false.

30 zerop is a test of whether its argument is zero

30 listp tests whether its argument is a list

30 (message STRING) prints STRING in the echo area

30 if there is a '%s' (a control sequence) in the string, the message function looks to the argument that follows the string and replaces '%s' with this second argument

31 '%d' is used for an integer

31 multiple '%s' and '%d' look for the corresponding value following the first string

32 set, setq and let assign a value to a variable

32 when using set, both the variable and the value need to be quoted, unless you want to evaluate them

32 setq is just like set, except that the first argument is quoted automatically

33 setq works in pairs

(setq trees '(pine fir oak)
      herbivores '(gazelle zebra antelope))

33 set and setq make a symbol 'point' to a value

33 initialize a counter (setq counter 0)

increment the counter (setq counter (+ counter 1))

33 anything to the right of ; is a comment

37 nil means false and is a synonym for ()

38 C-u C-x C-e (universal-argument prefix argument eval-last-sexp) puts the result of the evaluation in the buffer instead of the echo area

38 (current-buffer) returns the buffer itself

38 (other-buffer) #<buffer *scratch*>

(switch-to-buffer (other-buffer))

40 set-buffer appears in code instead of switch-to-buffer because programs "do not have eyes"

40 point is the position of the cursor

42 defun has up to five parts following defun:

1. the name of the symbol to which the function should be attached
2. a list of arguments or () if no arguments are to be passed
3. documentation
4. (interactive "OPTIONS") allows the function to be called with M-x or by typing a key
5. the body of the function (code)

43 a non-interactive function

(defun multiply-by-seven (number)
  "Multiply NUMBER by seven."
  (* 7 number))

43 C-h f describes a function

43 apropos prints only the first line of a multi-line documentation string

44 C-x C-e installs a function

45 most interactive functions are called for their side effects

46 an interactive version of multiply-by-seven

(defun multiply-by-seven-interactive (number)
  "Multiply NUMBER by seven."
  (interactive "p")
  (message "The result is %d" (* 7 number)))

46 "p" tells Emacs to pass the prefix argument to the function

46 run the interactive multiply-by-seven function with

C-u 6 M-x multiply-by-seven-interactive RET

C-u defaults to 4

47 M-<number> is the same as C-u <number>
