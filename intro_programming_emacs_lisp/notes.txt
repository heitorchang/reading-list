1 lists look like '(rose violet daisy buttercup). ' is "quote"

1 atoms are separated by whitespace and may be numbers, strings and symbols

2 () is both an atom and a list

4 q exits the debugger

9 a symbol may be called a variable because it holds a value that may vary

9 a symbol can have both a value and a function attached to it (think of a symbol being a chest of drawers, with a drawer for a value and another for a function)

10 binding a variable to a value is assigning it a value

12 (concat "abc" "def") produces "abcdef"

12 (substring "The quick brown fox jumped." 16 19) produces "fox"

12 (substring STRING BEGINNING-ZERO-INDEXED-INCLUSIVE END-EXCLUSIVE)

12 (number-to-string NUMBER) (int-to-string NUMBER)

13, 16, 18 'hello is a quoted symbol. It is the symbol itself. A quoted expression is returned as written, and not evaluated

14 marker is a special object representing a buffer position

14 -p at the end of a function stands for "predicate". The function determines whether some property is true or false.

14 zerop is a test of whether its argument is zero

14 listp tests whether its argument is a list

14 (message STRING) prints STRING in the echo area

14 if there is a '%s' in the string, the message function looks to the argument that follows the string and replaces '%s' with this second argument

15 '%d' is used for an integer

15 multiple '%s' and '%d' look for the corresponding value following the first string

16 set, setq and let assign a value to a variable

16 when using set, both the variable and the value need to be quoted, unless you want to evaluate them

16 setq is just like set, except that the first argument is quoted automatically

17 setq works in pairs

(setq trees '(pine fir oak)
      herbivores '(gazelle zebra antelope))

17 set and setq make a symbol 'point' to a value

17 initialize a counter (setq counter 0)

increment the counter (setq counter (+ counter 1))

17 anything to the right of ; is a comment
