58 functional tests are from the user's point of view
   unit tests are from the programmer's point of view
   functional = external, unit = internal

68 unit testing cycle
71 git log --oneline
74 trivial tests don't take time to write anyway, so don't complain
   it's good to have a placeholder
75 functional_tests typing (send_keys)
77 explicit wait
78 don't test constants such as HTML
79 templates
81 install app in settings.py
83 render_to_string (it's complicated)
83 Django Test Client assertTemplateUsed
85 when refactoring, change code or tests, but not both at the same time
87 write HTML to match functional test
91 functional tests are the final judge on whether the app works or not
93 simple POST form
93 if an unexpected error appears in a functional test, visit the page
   manually or add a time.sleep()
95 csrf_token
96 test save POST request: client.post
97 retrieve POST variable: request.POST['name']
100 f-string in helpful error message
101 "cheat" in template
101 Red, Green, Refactor: remove magic constants
    Triangulation: if the tests can be passed by cheating, write a better test
102 Three strikes and refactor
103 in functional_tests, put helper functions after tearDown()
105 Django ORM (test models)
105 save and retrieve item
106 a "real" unit test shouldn't touch the database
107 models.py: Item(models.Model)
107 migrations add and remove database tables. It's like version control for
    databases
108 makemigrations
108 even without a DB column, it is allowed to assign .text to an Item
108 TextField() in a model
109 default value in model field
110 save POST to DB in the test
111 save item in view
112 test: only saves when necessary
112 unit tests should only do one thing
113 redirect after POST
113 Item.objects.create(text=new_text) is equivalent to Item(); item.save()
114 test redirection
115 separate saving POST from redirect
116 test display of several items
117 template {% for item in items %}
118 SQLite DBs are disk files
119 python manage.py migrate
120 forloop.counter
121 git tag tagname
121 remove db.sqlite3, migrate (--noinput seems unnecessary)
122 regression: when new code breaks functionality that was working
    Red/Green/Refactor
123 Triangulation: add a new test to justify the generalization of the
    implementation
124 need to isolate tests
125 LiveServerTestCase creates a test DB
125 functional_tests/__init__.py (seems unnecessary)
125 git mv
126 python manage.py test functional_tests
127 LiveServerTestCase live_server_url
128 git diff --staged -M
129 unit tests: python manage.py test lists
130 implicit waits should be avoided
130 time.sleep(1) is an explicit wait
131 replace explicit waits with a tool that waits as much as needed, up to
    a timeout
133 use wait_for instead of check_for
134 purposely introduce errors
135 ensure test isolation and manage global state; reset any permanent state
    at the end of a test
135 avoid voodoo sleeps
135 don't rely on implicit waits
136 how to design multiple lists, each with its own URL?
137 instead of a long design process, create a minimum viable application as
    quickly as possible
138 You Ain't Gonna Need It! (YAGNI)
138 REST style (Representational State Transfer)
591 REST allows an user to obtain and update information about resources
138 REST suggests the URL
    /lists/<list_id>/  for a list,
    /lists/new
    /lists/<list_id>/add_item
    it is not strictly REST, only inspired by it
139 PUT is not available in HTML forms
139 add a new FT (functional test) for new functionality
140 regression test
140 rename current FT to list_for_one_user
141 multiple_users_at_different_urls
141 self.assertRegex(list_url, '/lists/.+')
141 second user
142 ## metacomments explain how the test works
142 page_text in FT
143 redirection after POST
