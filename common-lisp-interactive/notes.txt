11 a S-expression is a printed representation of an object (for example, a number or a list)

11 a list S-expression is a left parenthesis followed by zero or more S-expressions followed by a right parenthesis

12 the value of a quoted object is the object itself

21 a symbol's name is an instance of a string

21 a string is made up of characters. both strings and characters are Common Lisp object types

21 a string is a vector (single-dimensional array) of characters, such as "Hello"

22 a character may be given as '#\A (also unquoted, because it evaluates to itself)

25 the backslash (sometimes called "bash") is the escape character that allows typing a " inside a string (for example, "a\"b")

28 T and NIL are bound to themselves as values

28 to refer to a symbol as itself, quote it: 'pi

29 the value of a quoted object is the object itself

30 using escape brackets, lowercase letters can be part of a symbol's name: '|frank|

31 Common Lisp has typed objects, not typed variables. (type-of x) tells you of what type an object is

37 a symbol's qualified name is package-name::symbol-name and is used to refer to a symbol in another package

38 (export 'frank) exports the symbol from its home package and becomes an external symbol

38 a single colon in the result of an evaluation indicates it's an external symbol
     > 'cl-user::frank
     CL-USER:FRANK

39 (import 'cl-user:frank) allows referring to the symbol without using its package's name

40 when a symbol can be referred to with its unqualified name, it is said to be interned

42 (find-package :cl-user)

Web instead of make-package, use
      (defpackage :com.heitorchang.my-package
        (:use :common-lisp)) ; gigamonkeys.com
      Must use (in-package ...) next

FUNCTIONS

(function-call) ; page number => result

(length "a string") ; 22 => 8
(string= "abc" "def") ; 22 => NIL, limited to two strings
(char "hello" 0) ; 22 => #\h
(char= #\a #\a #\a) ; 23 => T, no limit of arguments
(eql 'pi 'PI) ; 29 => T, checks references to the same locations in memory
(symbol-name 'pi) ; 30 => "PI", a string
(type-of '+) ; 31 => SYMBOL
(type-of #'+) ; => COMPILED-FUNCTION
(eql "a" "a") ; 33 => WARNING: NIL, it checks locations in memory
(describe 'frank) ; 36 => (a description)
(describe 'describe) ; 36 => opens a browser. Note that describe is not sharp-quoted
(in-package :common-lisp) ; 36 => Note: book quotes the package name, while today's Lisp uses a colon
(list-all-packages) ; Web
